Figuring stuff out
Now What each File does:
    0= PWD > Print working directory. #Prints the full path of the current working directory.
    1= ls > list. # list files in the current directory
    2= cd > change directory. #Used to change directory. name a directory to move into it, leave blank to go up to root, use "cd .." to go up one level
    3= ls -l > -l for long format lists. #all -* letters are modifiers to a command (* is placement for the letter)
    4= ls -la > -a do not ignore entries starting with ".". # in ls -la its not its own modifer but rather its -l + -a, making a broader command that shows more infomation about each file as well as "hidden" files. List files and show permissions, user owner, group owner, last modified/created date
    5= ls -na > list digital files only. #
